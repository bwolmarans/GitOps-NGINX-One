# Demo: Managing NGINX with NGINX One using GitOps
This repository provides a sample Github Actions script that allows NGINX One users to manage versioning and deployment of NGINX configurations via Github actions.

## TLDR;
1. Set your F5 Distributed Cloud API token in the Actions secrets as XC_API_TOKEN
2. Using NGINX One Cloud Console, note your NGINX instance hostname
3. Set your N1C_TENANT_FQDN, NGINX_INSTANCE_HOSTNAME, and your N1C_NAMESPACE in the Actions variables, for example nginxone-team.staging.volterra.us as the tenant fqdn.
6. Clone the repo, and make a change to app-nyc-02/etc/nginx/nginx.conf and add a comment near the top, and commit. 
7. That will trigger the actions workflow, you can go and view this running under Actions
  

## NGINX Configurations
Configuration files are stored for each instance in this repository file structure.  See ```app-nyc-01``` for sample NGINX configurations found in nginx.conf

## Github Actions
The repository is configured to run the ```GitOps-NMS/.github/workflows/push-to-n1sc.yml``` Github Action on any commit and pull-request merge to the main branch. The script works by:

- Defining configuration files for a given instance in the repository
- Encoding configuration files to base64
- Pulling values from repository configuration variables (see table below)
- Generating a timestamp
- Incorporating all of these elements and sending an API call to the NGINX Management Suite instance accessible via the internet
