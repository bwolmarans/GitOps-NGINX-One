# Demo: Managing NGINX Configs with Github
This repository provides a sample Github Actions script that allows NGINX Instance Manager users to manage versioning and deployment of NGINX configurations via Github.

## NGINX Configurations
Configuration files are stored for each instance under management via a replica directory structure. See ```app-sfo-01``` for sample NGINX configurations.

## Github Actions
The repository is configured to run the ```GitOps-NMS/.github/workflows/push-to-nms.yml``` Github Action on any commit and pull-request merge to the main branch. The script works by:

- Defining configuration files for a given instance in the repository
- Encoding configuration files to base64
- Pulling values from repository configuration variables (see table below)
- Generating a timestamp
- Incorporating all of these elements and sending an API call to the NGINX Management Suite instance accessible via the internet

### Github Action Configuration Variables
The ```push-to-nms.yml``` Github Action can be configured by changing the following variables within the Github Repository Settings:

| Variable Name | Type          | Value (Description)                             |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| NMS_HOSTNAME  | Repo Variable | Fully qualified domain name of the NMS instance |
| NMS_USERNAME  | Repo Secret   | NMS username (default: admin)                   |
| NMS_PASSWORD  | Repo Secret   | NMS password for given username                 |

***Important*** Presently, the Github Action is configured to use Basic Authentication only. It does this by concatenating the username and password secrets, encoding the resulting string to base64 and including the encoded string as a request header in the NMS API call.
